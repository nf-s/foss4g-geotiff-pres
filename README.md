## Description

In 2019 there are a host of JavaScript libraries which make it possible to work with GeoTIFFs directly in the browser. In this talk we’ll look at how people can go about loading, visualising and even analysing GeoTIFFs with 0 server-side technology.

We’ll talk about some of the benefits of this approach, as well as some of the challenges and limitations that are encountered.

With GeoTIFF being the de facto raster format and a web-browser being an ever-available platform the opportunity to combine these technologies in a light-weight way to explore raster data is bound to open up opportunities.
