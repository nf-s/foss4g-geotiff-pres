In 2019 there are a host of JavaScript libraries which make it possible to work with GeoTIFFs directly in the browser. In this talk we’ll look at how people can go about loading, visualising and even analysing GeoTIFFs with 0 server-side technology.

We’ll talk about some of the benefits of this approach, as well as some of the challenges and limitations that are encountered.

With GeoTIFF being the de facto raster format and a web-browser being an ever-available platform the opportunity to combine these technologies in a light-weight way to explore raster data is bound to open up opportunities.




Hi,

Thanks for showing up!

Ill just quickly introduce myself -
I am a software engineer with CSIRO's Data61 - and I'm based in Hobart Tasmania

I create web mapping tools for natural hazard modelling - wildires, flooding, evacuation and climate change risk - all of which I know nothing about - I just show data on maps





TODO

add historical data - how to compare?

    Slider?
    Minus layers?
    Average band of years (eg 30 years)

Compare geotiff size with WMS tile size?

Look into reading NetCDF? - https://observablehq.com/@rveciana/trim-example3-netcdf

Tweak wet-bulb temperature with code editor?
